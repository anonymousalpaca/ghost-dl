# GHOST
GHOST (Goal-oriented Hyperparameter Optimization for Scalable Training) is a paradigm for fast training and tuning of deep learners for software engineering. We use DODGE for hyperparameter optimziation; as such, the code is based off the [DODGE repository](https://github.com/amritbhanu/Dodge). 

# Usage

- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the python3 dependencies and package (alternatively, run `make install`).
- Run `python3 main_[d2h|popt20].py`

# Research Questions

## Can deep learners be used in software engineer-ing without unreasonable training times?
